# about-me
Week 1 About Me project for Code 201.
This is my first project for my Code Fellows curriculum. The site is comprised of a series of prompts that are displayed when the user first logs on. The prompts begin with "Yes or No" type questions asked to the user about myself as a guessing game of random facts about me. Also asked is a number response question about my months lived in Seattle, and a fill in about states that I've previously lived in.
